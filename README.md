# [Next.js E-Commerce Storefront + TanStack React Query + Upstash ðŸ”—](https://filteration-maginaction.vercel.app/)

This project is an e-commerce storefront built with Next.js and TypeScript, showcasing the power of TanStack React Query for efficient data fetching and state management. It utilizes Upstash Vector DB for product information storage and retrieval, which enhances the filtering capabilities of the storefront. To optimize the user experience and protect the API routes, a debounce mechanism has been implemented to introduce a delay for user requests.

## Features

- **Next.js**: A React framework for production with server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript for type safety.
- **TanStack React Query**: A powerful library for fetching, caching, and updating data in React applications with minimal effort.
- **Upstash Vector DB**: A highly performant database tailored for vector operations, perfect for the product filtration feature in this e-commerce project.
- **Debounce**: An optimization technique to delay the execution of a function after the last event is detected, reducing the number of API calls.
